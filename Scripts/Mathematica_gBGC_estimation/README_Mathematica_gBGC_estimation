Here are files I modified from scripts provided by Glémin et al. 2015.

The main inference model is entirely due to Muyle et al. 2011 and Glémin et al. 2015
so if you use these scripts I encourage you to read and cite those studies.

I provide three example input files:

swe_sin_genomewide_noExons.txt - A simple case with a single derived allele frequency (DAF) spectrum to be used with gBGC_Estimation_genomewide_GH.nb. Note that only polymorphisms should be included, here we had a sample size of 10 diploid indiviudals. Thus the derived allele frequency class X20 is excluded.
swe_sin_genomewide_bs_noExons.txt - Contains 1000s DAFs produced by bootstrapping on sites. To be used with gBGC_Estimation_genomewide_bs_GH.nb. 
swe_sin_GC_centiles_noExons.txt - GC centiles, created by making a DAF of all sites included per centile of GC content in the ancestral Leptidea genome. To be used with gBGC_Estimation_GC_centiles_GH.nb
